                  Many students focus too much on the name of a program,
                  forgetting that the same major can be taught very differently
                  at different universities.
                </p>
                <p>Example: Bachelor of Commerce in Australia</p>

                  <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">University of Sydney: </span>
                    Research and theory-focused, with strong emphasis on
                    finance. Best suited for students interested in deep
                    academic study or pursuing graduate school.

                  <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Monash University: </span>
                    More practice-oriented, with strong industry connections and
                    many internship opportunities. A good fit for students who
                    want to enter the workforce early.

                  Instead of choosing programs based on their name, like
                  "Business Analytics" because it sounds impressive or
                  "Economics" because it seems prestigious, take time to review
                  each university‚Äôs curriculum, available internships, and talk
                  to current students about their experience.

                    <span>
                      Most universities allow students to switch majors after
                      the first year or during the first semester of the second
                      year, as long as you maintain a good GPA and meet the new
                      major‚Äôs prerequisites.

                    <span>
                      In reality, employers care more about your skills and
                      experience than your exact degree title.

                        Many Marketing graduates become successful Product
                        Managers.

                        It's also common to move from Finance into Data

                      The most important factor is your relevant skills and your
