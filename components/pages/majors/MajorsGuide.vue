                When preparing to study abroad, choosing your major is the most crucial
                decision because it directly impacts two vital factors:
                <span class="font-semibold">education quality</span> and
                <span class="font-semibold">career prospects/settlement opportunities</span>.
            </div>
            <div>
                Not every country excels in all fields. For example, studying creative
                fields in Europe (France or Italy) might be stronger and significantly
                cheaper than in the US. Another example: If you study STEM in the US,
                you're almost guaranteed a 3-year STEM OPT, but in Australia, you might
                not make it onto the Skilled Occupation List for job application
                advantages.

                Your major is also a key factor in choosing universities because
                <span class="font-semibold">program rankings matter more than overall university rankings</span>.
            </div>
            <div>
                You don’t need to choose perfectly from day one of university, but you
                definitely shouldn’t choose randomly. Many students mistakenly think
                choosing "hot" majors like business analytics or data science guarantees
                success, but even trending fields can lead to unemployment.

                    There are no ‘hot’ majors, only skilled professionals who bring value
                    to customers and society – that’s what makes individuals ‘hot’.
