Getting a meaningful internship in high school might seem impossible. While your college friends have career fairs and established recruiting paths, you're left wondering if anyone will take a chance on you. But here's the truth: real opportunities exist, even if the path isn't obvious. Two Things Matter Most: - Who You Know - Your network - How Bold You Are - Sometimes you need to ignore the \"requirements\" and just go for it Start Building Your Network (You Already Have One): - Your teachers are your first champions - build genuine relationships with them - Connect with your friends' parents who work in interesting fields - Reach out to former students who've landed great internships - Join online communities where professionals hang out (Stack Overflow, GitHub, relevant forums) Be Bold: - Apply for college internships anyway - my friend landed at NASA this way - Reach out directly to companies you admire - Don't limit yourself to familiar industries - Keep following up - persistence often matters more than perfection Remember: Companies aren't just looking for experience (you're in high school - they know you don't have much). They're looking for curiosity, initiative, and eagerness to learn. Sometimes getting that dream internship is simply about being brave enough to ask and persistent enough to keep asking. Your first step? Pick one person in your network - a teacher, a friend's parent, anyone - and reach out this week. The worst they can say is no.
